###### Some useful information:

The .txt file is loaded in memory and implemented as a doubly linked list.

Contents of .txt file are split into words, coupled with the line numbers they appear on and inserted in an Arraylist

before written to .ndx file.

Line size, maximum word size, minimum word size as well as disk page size are all defined in MyEditor.class and can be changed

to suit your system's needs. (default values: 80, 20, 5, 128)

Words of length > max size are trimmed down to max size.

Words of length < min size are not included in the .ndx file.
